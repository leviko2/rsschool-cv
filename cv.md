## Code Examples
**Prime Number Check Example -**

A small JavaScript script that checks if a given number is a prime number (without using functions):

```javascript
let n = 13; // Number to check
let isPrime = true;

if (n <= 1) {
  isPrime = false;
} else {
  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
    if (n % i === 0) {
      isPrime = false;
      break;
    }
  }
}

if (isPrime) {
  console.log(n + " is a prime number.");
} else {
  console.log(n + " is NOT a prime number.");
}
